# Infrastructure-Node-CloudServices-Lib

## Purpose

This library will include common class abstractions and implementations (AWS to start) of common cloud services such as working with 
queues, serverless functions, and pubsub events models.

## Overview

/src contains *.ts file
/test contains *.ts or *.js files

*note* if your tests require a heavy amount of integration or sample data, consider writing them completly in .js and use `npm run testjs`

## Test

`npm test` or `gulp test`

Issue with test coverage? `npm run test-coverage` or `gulp test-coverage`

## Publishing

Until Artifactory is established, the simple (but redundant) way to ship is to generate /lib via:

`npm run build` or `gulp build`

## Usage

- npm install @types/node --save-dev 
- npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:Placester/Infrastructure-Node-TsLib-Template.git#TAG
- - where TAG is a branch name or commit found on [releases](https://github.com/Placester/Infrastructure-Node-TsLib-Template/tags)
